# Price Prediction for Airbnb Listings in San Francisco

**Introduction:**

Airbnb is an online marketplace for owners to list their properties so that guests can rent to stay for lodging and tourism activities. 
Even though Airbnb provides general guidance currently there is no free service that will help owners to set the prices.
Our goal is to develop a machine learning model that will help owners to set the prices for their properties using the pricing data for other listings in San Francisco.

**Data:**

Data for this project is obtained from Inside Airbnb website: http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html. The data is scraped at different time points for various locations from the Airbnb website. More data can be found at the archive section as well. 
We will use two csv files in this project:
**listings_detailed.csv:** Detailed information for each listing found on Airbnb website in San Francisco at the time of scraping.
**calendar.csv:**  Pricing information for each listing for the coming year.

Both files can be found at:
