    "1. Did ordinal encoder for the host_response_time. \n",
    "2. Processed the host_verifications column and did ordinal encoding.\n",
    "3. Dropped the neighbourhood column since it encodes for large cities/areas that would not provide detailed information.\n",
    "4. Renamed neighbourhood_cleansed column as neighbourhood and will do dummy transformation using pd.get_dummies().\n",
    "5. Dropped the property_type column since it contains subgroups of room_type such as entire_home_bungalow etc. Renamed room_type as property type and will use pd.get_dummies(). \n",
    "6. Amenities column was converted a list and in turn a set of all amenities in the data frame. Created new columns by encoding amenities for their presence in the listinf. Details are in data wrangling notebook.\n",
    "7. host_since column was converted to date time and created a new column as host_days_active by subtracting host_since from 2020_03_02. host_since column is dropped.\n",
    "8. Repeated same process for first_review and last_review columns. \n",
    "9. Replaced missing values with median value of the columns"
